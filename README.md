# p2p-network

The idea of this project is to develop a functional peer-to-peer network with multiple utilities.

- [ ] Establish connections between nodes
- [ ] Traffic encryption (maybe using TLS?)
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the network (maybe using DHT?)
- [ ] Implement file sharing
- [ ] Implement pubsub
- [ ] Implement customizable protocols
- [ ] Use cryptographic tool to improve the robustness of the network
